# Overview
Using the dataset [ClArTTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00069) we Train VITS model based on the paper by [Jaehyeon Kim, Jungil Kong, and Juhee Son](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06103) 

## Phonitization and Diacritization
for Phonitization we use the library created by [Youssef Sherif](https://pypi.org/project/arabic-pronounce/) and for Diacritization we used library made by [Farasa](https://github.com/MagedSaeed/farasapy)

## Model
VITS model architecture was provided by [coqui-ai](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) and trained for 4 % of its needed training on A100 colab GPU (Note: model is not fully trained due to the lack of resources i have if i am able to train the model further i will keep this repository updated)
